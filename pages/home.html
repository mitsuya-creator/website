          <h2>Mitsuya Takashi</h2>
          <h5>Hello, my name is Mitsuya, this's not my REAL NAME</h5>
          <p>
            I use it as alias, because i am fan to him as a character in Tokyo
            Manji Gang
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy Creating article, Thinking, technology and slepp:), I work
            in the Airdrop Enthusiast and interesting and learning about web
            development.
          </p>

          <h6>Experience:</h6>
          <p>
            I have no experience too much, i am alumnus from computer science in
            vocational highschool in 2020, yep the year that corona virus disease started in my country.<br>
            I'm only know a few about my vocational education, such as
            components computer, IP Address, Domain Name System, Web server, and
            network infrastructure. <br>
            I have worked at a company run in telecommunications field as Data Entry, yahh working use Microsoft office especially Word and Excel at least for six months, it's right six months is not too long. i was resign and try to other passion. Actually I'm not interested about that, I'm excited about technology and programming more.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Now, I am interesting about web development, so i learn bit by
            bit-step by step about that, for example this <b>page</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually, a few years ago, i had been interesting about web
            development when i configured a routerboard to made WLAN, how can it
            be? i made WLAN which when someone tried to connecting their device
            for example mobile or laptop to WLAN, they would be asked for
            verification first to connected to internet. And that verification
            used web page as form to enter username and password. Because I felt
            bored about that web page that which display by default. i thought,
            "how to changed this page?, that so bored only put form username and
            password", i searched on internet "how to by how to" and got what i
            thought. I found to changed that web page using template, and i did
            that. that code to change web page, i copy and paste that code to
            routerboard. and i thought "how to add myname in this page, how to
            made my own page" hmmm, interested. "that pages built using
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS. so if you wanna built your own page, you
            had to understood about that"-contain of the page i visited, that's
            when i was interested about web development.
